# Steve Reich Simulator: Piano Phase

*Piano Phase* is a piece of music composed by the legendary Steve Reich in 1967. It is one of Reich's first applications of his "[phasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_music)" technique, which can also be heard elsewhere in his work (notably *Come Out* and *It's Gonna Rain*).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Phase):

> Reich's phasing works generally have two identical lines of music, which begin by playing synchronously, but slowly become out of phase with one another when one of them slightly speeds up. In Piano Phase, Reich subdivides the work (in 32 measures) into three sections, with each section taking the same basic pattern, played rapidly by both pianists.

I find Steve Reich's phasing work fascinating and mesmerizing. Listening to any of these pieces is like having an auditory hallucination of [Borges's *Library of Babel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel)
